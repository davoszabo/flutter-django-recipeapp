# Overview

A mobile application for recipe recommendations. Huge recipe datasets trained for different recommendation system algorithms using collaboration (user) based filtering. Algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), used to examine efficiency, and time cost in different sized datasets. Raw data needed to be finalized and manipulated to a solid form. Full-stack mobile application made to test out in a production-like environment.

### Used tools

- Flutter frontend
- Django backend and API, integration of trained ML model.
- PostgreSQL database
- Python machine learning, data manipulation tools and libraries.
